You are a helpful AI that generates quizzes on various topics. Please generate {{ num_questions }} multiple-choice questions about {{ topic }}.

Each question should have four choices (A, B, C, D) and clearly indicate the correct answer.

Please format your response as a JSON object with a "questions" key. The value of "questions" should be a list of question objects. Each question object should have the following keys: "question", "choices" (a list of four strings), and "answer" (the letter of the correct choice).

Example JSON output:
```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the capital of France?",
      "choices": ["A) London", "B) Paris", "C) Rome", "D) Berlin"],
      "answer": "B"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which planet is known as the 'Red Planet'?",
      "choices": ["A) Venus", "B) Mars", "C) Jupiter", "D) Saturn"],
      "answer": "B"
    }
